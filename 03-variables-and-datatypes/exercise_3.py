# Built-in data types
# In this exercise you will create a script comprising airline passenger information. You
# must choose the most appropriate data type for each item of data. In practice, it is
# unlikely that you will hard-code data into a script in this manner, but the purpose of the
# exercise is to make you familiar with the built-in data types at your disposal. Don't forget
# about Python's naming conventions.
# 1. Create a script named ch3_data_types.py.
# 2. Declare and assign one variable for each of the items of data tabled below.

# Description             Value
# ID                      1234
# First name              John
# Last name               Doe
# Checked bags            False
# Visited countries       Latvia, Guyana, Yemen, Uzbekistan
# Flight                  LGW to CDG
# Flight time             1 hour 15 minutes

# 3. Print each variable and its data type to the console.
