----------
1. List some of the characteristics of Python.
OO
interpreted
platform agnostic - runs anywhere
light syntax using indents not braces
dynamic typing with type inference 
not named after snakes
free and open source
large dev community
lots of free open source modules on pypi.org

2. The Python interpreter can be executed in two ways. What are they?
script mode 
interactive on terminal (REPL shell)

3. How should variables and functions be named in Python?
lower_case_underscore_separated
not starting with a number

reference to a memory address where data is stored
two types of data:
immutable values (int, str, float, bool) or
reference to some values that can change (container types, objects)
NOTE: mutable container or wrapper types may themeselves contain references to immutable

5. Describe each part of the following statement:

0.0 
"" 
False (the actual value, no change here) 
() 
[] 
{} empty SET 
dict() empty dict 
None 

9. What value does the number 1 become when passed to a float() wrapper function?
1.0 

10. What value does the string value "Hello" become when passed to a bool() wrapper function?
True
AND,
"False" ALSO becomes True
